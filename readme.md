# FD Careers Application

![Firefighter Group][image]

FD Careers was originally founded in 1992 by a firefighter. We started out by sending out postcards for fire tests in Illinois. We've changed quite a bit over the last twenty years, but our #1 goal has alway been to help you become a firefighter.

We are always looking for new ways to help you achieve your goals, as well as ways to improve our service. If you have a suggestion or idea, please let us know!

Just shoot us an email at [info@fdcareers.com][1] and we'll try to make it happen.
